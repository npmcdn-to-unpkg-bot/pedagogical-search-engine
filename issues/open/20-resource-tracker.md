Description
======================
Implement a Resource Tracker which is able to give the state of each resource. (e.g. Already crawled? In .rsc? In .arsc? ..)

Comment
======================
Why tracking the resource (.rsc) files with an external data base? The state of each resource could be embedded in each (.rsc) file.
