What
------------------------
An annotation file contains tags for a document (or for parts of the
document in the case of table of contents).

() Problem
	() Tags cannot be exhaustive
	() How to define the precision of our algorithm then?
	() How to define recall?

() Solution
	() Write all tags that are relevant to the document and that users might search for
	() Precision means: How relevant are the indexes produces
		() Instead of counting the number of indexes that are listed as tags
			() If index is in the tags => count 1
			() Otherwise, score how close an index is from its closest tag.
				e.g. WLM: [0, 16] -> count [0, 1]
	() Recall means: What is the proportion of tags that the indexes cover?
		() Recall is computed as usual then.
