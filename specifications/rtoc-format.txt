Format Specifications Of [Raw Table Of Content] (.rtoc)
================================
The following data is handled
	(d1) TOC metadata. e.g. Title, Publisher, Date, version, Authors, ..
	(d2) TOC structure

Format type
	JSON

JSON Elements
	(metadata) Contains the TOC metadata .. type: (d1)
	(label) Contains the text of the TOC entry .. type: (d2)
	(children) Contains the nested entries .. type: (d2)

How Elements are organized
	Each TOC node may have a (label) and (children).
	If no (label) is specified, an empty "" string is assigned.
	If no (children) is specified, the TOC entry is considered as a leaf.
	If not (label) and no (children) are specified, the node is discarded.

	The first object contains only a optional (metadata) object and
	a mandatory (children) array which contains the entries from the
	table of content.

Notes
	(n1) There are no constraints on the (label)s.
		They may or may not contain an indication about the Structure.
		e.g. "Chap 3: Advanced concept", or simply "Advanced concept"
	(n2) In the case that the (label)s may contain some structure
		indications, then there are no constraints on their format.
		e.g. "Chap 3: ..", "Chapter 3: ..", "3) ..", "[Three] ..", ..
	(n3) There are no constraints on the content of the (metadata) object.
